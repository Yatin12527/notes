# How the networking and Internet protocols finalized ?

### How Protocols Become Standards



You might wonder, who decides these rules? Networking and internet protocols don't just appear out of nowhere; they are finalized through a strict **process of standardization**.

**1. The Organizations**
This process is managed by major organizations like the **IETF** (Internet Engineering Task Force) and the **IEEE** (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers). Their job is to agree on how things should work.

**2. The Foundation**
They build these standards based on layered models, specifically the **TCP/IP model**. This model acts as the blueprint, defining specific protocols for specific tasks:
* **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Handles reliable delivery.
* **IP (Internet Protocol):** Handles routing.

**3. The Goal: Interoperability**
The main reason for this entire process is to enable **interoperability**. By standardizing the communication rules (from how a packet is routed to how data is delivered), they ensure that **diverse hardware and software** from different companies can all work together seamlessly.

### The Protocol Finalization Process


Creating a network protocol isn't just about writing code; it follows a strict "Finalization Process" to ensure the whole world stays connected. This process involves four key stages:

**1. Standardization (The Formal Rules)**
First, the process is formalized by major global organizations like the **IETF** (Internet Engineering Task Force) and the **IEEE**.
* **The Goal:** They define and publish these protocols to guarantee **interoperability**. This ensures that devices from different manufacturers can communicate consistently across different networks.

**2. Layered Architecture (The Structure)**
The final protocols are not designed in isolation; they are built to work within a specific **layered framework**, such as the **TCP/IP model**.
* **Why?** This divides network communication into distinct layers, allowing different protocols to be responsible for specific, manageable functions.

**3. Protocol Development (The Specific Jobs)**
Specific protocols are then developed to handle the unique aspects of communication at each layer:
* **Application Layer:** Protocols like **HTTP** and **DNS** are built to manage user-facing applications.
* **Transport Layer:** Protocols like **TCP** and **UDP** are created to segment data into packets and ensure reliable, ordered delivery.
* **Internet Layer:** The **IP** protocol is developed to handle addressing (IP addresses) and finding the best route for packets.
* **Network Access Layer:** Protocols here handle the actual physical transmission through hardware like **Ethernet** or **Wi-Fi**.

**4. Testing and Adoption (The Rollout)**
Once defined, these protocols are implemented into actual hardware and software.
* **Evolution:** Their success is marked by widespread adoption and continued evolution. A prime example of this is the transition from **IPv4 to IPv6**, which solidifies their place as the standard for internet communication.
