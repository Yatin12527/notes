Here is the fully expanded version with **8 distinct, high-value points** to ensure you exceed the "7 points" requirement. I have combined the basic info from the image with standard networking concepts to make this a complete answer.

### Analog vs. Digital Signals: The Complete Comparison


**1. Nature of Continuity**
* **Analog:** It is a **continuous** signal. It moves smoothly without breaks.
* **Digital:** It is a **discrete (discontinuous)** signal. It steps abruptly from one value to the next.

**2. Representation of Data**
* **Analog:** Represents data as a physical wave (voltage, current, etc.) that mirrors the original source (like sound).
* **Digital:** Represents data in **Binary Language** (0s and 1s). The information is broken down into numerical bits.

**3. Effect of Noise (Distortion)**
* **Analog:** Highly sensitive to noise. If static mixes with the signal, it is nearly impossible to remove because the "noise" looks just like the signal.
* **Digital:** Immune to noise. Even if the signal gets "fuzzy" during transmission, the receiver can easily distinguish a High (1) from a Low (0) and reconstruct a perfect copy.

**4. Storage and Copying**
* **Analog:** Difficult to store accurately. Copying an analog signal (like recording a tape from another tape) always results in a loss of quality (generation loss).
* **Digital:** Easy to store (CDs, USBs). Can be copied billions of times without losing a single bit of quality.

**5. Transmission over Distance**
* **Analog:** When traveling long distances, the signal gets weak. Amplifiers are used to boost it, but they boost the **noise** along with the signal, degrading quality over time.
* **Digital:** Uses "Repeaters" instead of amplifiers. A repeater reads the weak signal, completely **regenerates** it from scratch, and sends it forward as good as new.

**6. Encryption and Security**
* **Analog:** Very difficult to encrypt. Security is low, and signals can be easily intercepted (tapped).
* **Digital:** Extremely secure. Mathematical algorithms can easily encrypt the stream of 0s and 1s, making it unreadable to anyone without the key.

**7. Bandwidth Usage**
* **Analog:** generally consumes **less bandwidth** for simple tasks (like a standard voice call).
* **Digital:** Often requires **more bandwidth** because converting a smooth wave into millions of bits creates a larger volume of data to send.

**8. Hardware Complexity**
* **Analog:** Hardware is often simpler and cheaper for basic tasks (built with simple resistors, capacitors, and op-amps).
* **Digital:** Hardware is more complex (requires microcontrollers, logic gates, and timing circuits), though modern technology has made this very cheap.

**Visual Summary (for the diagram marks):**
* **Draw Analog as:** A smooth, rolling sine wave.
* **Draw Digital as:** A blocky "square wave" that looks like steps or a city skyline.
